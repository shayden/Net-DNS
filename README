Perl DNS Resolver Module
========================

Copyright (c) 1997 Michael Fuhr.  All rights reserved.  This program is free
software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as
Perl itself. 

*** THIS VERSION OF Net::DNS IS FOR TESTING AND STILL CONTAINS BUGS ***

See the BUGS section.


DESCRIPTION
===========

Net::DNS is a Perl interface to the DNS resolver.  It allows the 
programmer to perform any type of DNS query.  For details, see the
Net::DNS manual page.

This version (0.02) is written entirely in Perl; version 0.01 was
written mostly in C.  The Perl version runs quite a bit slower, but
considering that the network can be a serious bottleneck when making
DNS queries, the speed difference may not really matter in most cases.

The author invites feedback on the module, particularly at this early
stage of its development.


INSTALLATION
============

This version of Net::DNS uses IO::Socket, which is part of the
IO module available on CPAN archives.

To build this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


RUNNING TESTS
=============

There aren't many tests in this version.  Part of the problem is creating
a test suite to work on systems both with and without Internet connectivity.
Future versions of this module will have more tests but will probably
require some site-specific configuration before running them.


DEMONSTRATION SCRIPTS
=====================

There are a few demonstration scripts in the demo/ directory.  See
demo/README for more info.

The author would be happy to include any contributed scripts in future
versions of this module.  All I ask is that they be documented (preferably
using POD) and that the contributor's name and contact information be
mentioned somewhere.


BUGS
====

The module isn't complete yet and contains a few bugs.  See the TODO
file for more info.
