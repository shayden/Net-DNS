Perl DNS Resolver Module
========================

Copyright (c) 1997 Michael Fuhr.  All rights reserved.  This program is free
software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as
Perl itself. 

*** THIS VERSION OF Net::DNS IS FOR TESTING AND STILL CONTAINS BUGS ***

See the BUGS section.


DESCRIPTION
===========

Net::DNS is a Perl interface to the DNS resolver.  It allows the 
programmer to perform any type of DNS query.  For details, see the
Net::DNS manual page.

As of version 0.02, Net::DNS is written entirely in Perl.  Version 0.01
was written mostly in C and used the system's resolver.  The Perl version
runs quite a bit slower, but considering that the network can be a serious
bottleneck when making DNS queries, the speed difference may not really
matter in most cases.  However, future versions may contain some C for those
who wish to link against libresolv.

The author invites feedback on the module, particularly at this early
stage of its development.


INSTALLATION
============

This version of Net::DNS uses IO::Socket, which is part of the
IO module available on CPAN.  You'll need to have IO installed
before using Net::DNS.

To build this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


RUNNING TESTS
=============

There aren't many tests in this version.  Part of the problem is creating
a test suite to work on systems both with and without Internet connectivity.
Future versions of this module will have more tests but will probably
require some site-specific configuration before running them.


DEMONSTRATION SCRIPTS
=====================

There are a few demonstration scripts in the demo/ directory.  See
demo/README for more info.

The author would be happy to include any contributed scripts in future
versions of this module.  All I ask is that they be documented (preferably
using POD) and that the contributor's name and contact information be
mentioned somewhere.


BUGS
====

The module isn't complete yet and is sure to contain a few bugs.  See
the TODO and Changes files for more info.
