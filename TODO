To Do list for Net::DNS
=======================

Check for invalid RR types or classes.

Check query IDs.

Handle "host is down" error in Resolver.pm.

Net::DNS::Packet->data currently returns only header and question section
data.  Need to return data for the entire packet.

Improve the error handling and reporting.

Implement TCP queries.

Add DNS Dynamic Updates (RFC 2136).

Add more RR types.

Accept options in resolver config files.

Work on more test cases.

Write more demo scripts, including a CGI interface to the resolver.

Check code for conformance to the guidelines listed in The Perl 5 Module
List.  Check style & efficiency according to the perlstyle manpage and
the Camel.

Consider providing an .xs file for those who wish to link against
libresolv instead of using the entirely-Perl resolver.
