To do list for Net::DNS
=======================

Net::DNS::Packet->data currently returns only header and question section
data.  Need to return data for the entire packet.

Improve the error handling and reporting.

Implement TCP queries.

Implement background queries.

Accept options in resolver config files.

Work on more test cases.

Write more demo scripts, including a CGI interface to the resolver.

Contact maintainers of DNS Tools pages.  A couple of places to start are:

    http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/tools.html
    http://www.isc.org/bind/index.html

Check code for conformance to the guidelines listed in The Perl 5 Module
List.  Check style & efficiency according to the Camel.
