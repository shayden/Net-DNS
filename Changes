Revision history for Net::DNS
=============================

*** 0.04  13 Feb 1997

Added background queries.  See the examples in the Net::DNS and
Net::DNS::Resolver manpages.

Added zone transfers and some error reporting to demo/perldig.  Also
added the ability to query a specific nameserver.

Added a check to end zone transfers when we receive a second SOA RR
(would block waiting for more input when doing zone transfers from
certain nameservers).  Also added some additional output if debugging
is turned on.


*** 0.03  8 Feb 1997

Added zone transfers.  Wrote demo/check_zone.  Minor corrections and
additions to the documentation.


*** 0.02  2 Feb 1997

Rewritten to be entirely Perl.  No longer uses the system's resolver
library or the resparse library.  Net::Resolver needs some work
on error reporting and needs to implement TCP queries.


*** 0.01  26 Jan 1997

Initial release for testing.  Still some bugs, particularly in
memory management.
