Revision history for Net::DNS
=============================

*** 0.03  8 Feb 1996

Added zone transfers.  Wrote demo/check_zone.  Minor corrections and
additions to the documentation.

*** 0.02  2 Feb 1996

Rewritten to be entirely Perl.  No longer uses the system's resolver
library or the resparse library.  Net::Resolver needs some work
on error reporting and needs to implement TCP queries.

*** 0.01  26 Jan 1996

Initial release for testing.  Still some bugs, particularly in
memory management.
