Revision history Net::DNS

*** 0.02  2 Feb 1996

Rewritten to be entirely Perl.  No longer uses the system's resolver
library or the resparse library.  Net::Resolver needs some work
on error reporting and needs to implement TCP queries.

*** 0.01  26 Jan 1996

Initial release for testing.  Still some bugs, particularly in
memory management.
